# space-game-releases

## preAlpha-releases

#### 0.2.0
First of all in this release i fixed the really buggy intro. There is no forward button anymore just click anywhere to progress
For the game there where sadly no real big changes but here is a list of the most value things that have changed:    
* On the bottom left is a new button for special missions (the button will disapear when the mission is accepted until the next mission is available)
* There is now a better timer management that in used via events and can be used for varius different scenarios
* Code refactor and adding more use of events to decouple the UI from the models
* There is a linux build available from now on in the releases. If that worked out i will add windows too.

This are the main points to mention for this release as i was busy with other stuff.
Also i did a lot of work for the new website design. Still missing lots of texts for my post but the design and the structure is coming out nicely. But if youre interested check it out under [bau.steinchen website](http://bau-steinchen.duckdns.org/) and any feedback is appreciated.

##### Release reason
As there is already a lot of time since the last release and also this time including a PC release this time (Linux for now for testing)

##### Known problems
* playing on PC need to use ALT+F4 to exit
* applying a room to a tile where already a room is will override the current room
